# Canvas Design

## Overview
Canvas design involves creating original visual artwork, posters, and static designs using programmatic or generative approaches. This skill should be invoked when users request posters, artwork, designs, or static visual pieces that require thoughtful composition and artistic vision.

## Core Principles
- **Composition**: Balance form, space, color, and typography effectively
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Guide the viewer's eye through intentional layout
- **Color Theory**: Use color harmonies to create mood and impact
- **Typography Integration**: Select and pair fonts thoughtfully

## Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Clarify the purpose and audience for the design
- [ ] Gather inspiration and reference materials
- [ ] Plan the composition and visual hierarchy
- [ ] Select color palette and typography

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Define Philosophy**: Create design philosophy document
2. **Plan Composition**: Sketch layout with form, space, and flow
3. **Select Colors**: Define color palette based on brand or concept
4. **Generate Canvas**: Create artwork with design-forward elements
5. **Refine**: Polish for visual impact and clarity
6. **Export**: Save as PNG or PDF at appropriate resolution

## Do's and Don'ts
- ✅ **Do** start with a clear concept and message
- ✅ **Do** use limited color palette for impact
- ✅ **Do** ensure readability and visual hierarchy
- ❌ **Don't** overcrowd the design with too many elements
- ❌ **Don't** ignore spacing and visual breathing room
- ❌ **Don't** use clashing or未经调和的颜色

## Anti-Patterns
- **Visual Clutter**: Adding too many elements without purpose
- **No Hierarchy**: Equal weight given to all elements
- **Color Chaos**: Using too many competing colors
- **Generic Design**: Following trends without original expression
