# bun-runtime

## Overview
When you need fast JavaScript runtime with built-in tooling

## Process
1. Initialize Bun project with bun init
2. Write TypeScript code with Bun APIs
3. Use Bun's built-in package manager
4. Run scripts with bun run
5. Deploy to Bun-compatible platforms

## Examples
- High-performance servers
- Scripting with native speed
- All-in-one JavaScript toolkit

## Limitations
Smaller ecosystem than Node.js; less mature
