# docker-swarm

## Overview
When you need to deploy and manage containers across multiple hosts

## Process
1. Initialize Docker Swarm cluster
2. Create overlay network for service communication
3. Define services in docker-compose.yml
4. Deploy services with docker stack deploy
5. Scale services and manage replicas

## Examples
- Multi-container application deployment
- Service scaling and load balancing
- Container orchestration without Kubernetes

## Limitations
Less feature-rich than Kubernetes; not ideal for complex microservice architectures
