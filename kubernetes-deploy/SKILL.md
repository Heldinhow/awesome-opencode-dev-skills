# kubernetes-deploy

## Overview
When you need to deploy containerized applications to Kubernetes

## Process
1. Create Docker container image
2. Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, etc.)
3. Apply manifests to cluster
4. Configure ingress for external access
5. Monitor deployment and scale as needed

## Examples
- Container orchestration
- Microservices deployment
- Auto-scaling applications

## Limitations
Requires Kubernetes cluster; steep learning curve
