# fastify-rest

## Overview
When you need to create performant REST APIs in Node.js

## Process
1. Initialize Fastify project
2. Define route schemas with JSON Schema
3. Implement route handlers
4. Add plugins for functionality
5. Configure logging and error handling

## Examples
- Building high-throughput APIs
- Creating microservices
- Performance-critical REST services

## Limitations
Less ecosystem compared to Express; steeper learning curve for schema validation
