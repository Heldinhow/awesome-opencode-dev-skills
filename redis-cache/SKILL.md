# redis-cache

## Overview
When you need to cache frequently accessed data or session data

## Process
1. Connect to Redis server
2. Define cache strategy (write-through, write-behind, look-aside)
3. Implement cache operations (get, set, delete)
4. Set appropriate TTL values
5. Handle cache invalidation

## Examples
- Caching API responses
- Session storage
- Rate limiting counters

## Limitations
Not suitable for data requiring strong consistency or complex queries
