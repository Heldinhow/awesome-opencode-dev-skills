# copilot-cli-subagents

## Overview
When you need to execute multiple independent tasks in parallel using Copilot

## Process
1. Enter plan mode (Shift+Tab) for complex tasks
2. Define implementation plan with subtasks
3. Execute with /fleet command
4. Monitor with /tasks command
5. Review and integrate results

## Examples
- Implementing multiple features simultaneously
- Running independent refactoring tasks
- Coordinating custom agents for specialized work

## Limitations
Higher API costs with multiple subagents; not for sequential dependent tasks
