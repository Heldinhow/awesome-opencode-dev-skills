# superpowers-patterns

## Overview
When you need battle-tested development patterns and collaboration workflows

## Process
1. For TDD: Write failing test first, then minimal code, then refactor
2. For debugging: Reproduce, isolate, fix, add regression test
3. Use /brainstorm for ideation
4. Use /write-plan for planning
5. Use /execute-plan for execution

## Examples
- Test-driven development
- Bug fixing and debugging
- Team collaboration workflows

## Limitations
Requires discipline to follow patterns consistently
