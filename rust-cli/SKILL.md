# rust-cli

## Overview
When creating CLI tools in Rust

## Process
1. Initialize Rust project with cargo
2. Set up CLI argument parsing (clap)
3. Implement command handlers
4. Add proper error handling
5. Build and test executable

## Examples
- Building command-line tools
- Systems programming utilities
- High-performance CLI applications

## Limitations
Steeper learning curve than scripting languages
