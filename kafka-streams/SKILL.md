# kafka-streams

## Overview
When building real-time data processing pipelines

## Process
1. Set up Kafka cluster and topics
2. Create Kafka Streams application
3. Define stream processing topology
4. Implement transformations and aggregations
5. Handle state and windowing

## Examples
- Real-time analytics
- Event processing pipelines
- Stream transformations

## Limitations
Requires Kafka cluster; complex state management
