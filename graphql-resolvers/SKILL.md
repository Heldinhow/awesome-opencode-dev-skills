# graphql-resolvers

## Overview
When building GraphQL APIs requiring data resolution

## Process
1. Define GraphQL types and fields
2. Implement resolver functions for each field
3. Handle async data fetching with DataLoader
4. Implement mutations with input types
5. Handle errors and edge cases

## Examples
- Building GraphQL API backends
- Connecting to multiple data sources
- Handling complex data relationships

## Limitations
N+1 query problems without DataLoader; requires GraphQL understanding
