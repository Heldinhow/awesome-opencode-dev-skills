# debugging

## Overview
When encountering bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior in code

## Process
1. Reproduce the issue consistently
2. Gather relevant error messages and logs
3. Isolate the problem area through binary search
4. Form and test hypotheses
5. Implement fix and verify resolution

## Examples
- Fixing production bugs
- Resolving test failures
- Troubleshooting integration issues

## Limitations
Not effective for issues that cannot be reproduced
