# graphql-api

## Overview
When you need flexible APIs with precise data requirements or nested data fetching

## Process
1. Define GraphQL schema with types, queries, mutations
2. Implement resolver functions for each field
3. Set up query optimization with DataLoader
4. Add input validation and error handling
5. Document with GraphQL Playground or GraphiQL

## Examples
- Building flexible APIs for mobile apps
- Aggregating data from multiple sources
- API with complex nested queries

## Limitations
Overhead for simple CRUD APIs; caching challenges
