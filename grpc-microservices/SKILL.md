# grpc-microservices

## Overview
When you need high-performance, type-safe communication between services

## Process
1. Define .proto files with messages and services
2. Generate code from proto definitions
3. Implement gRPC server and client
4. Set up service discovery and load balancing
5. Handle streaming and error handling

## Examples
- High-performance inter-service communication
- Polyglot microservices architectures
- Real-time streaming between services

## Limitations
Requires .proto definitions; not browser-friendly
