# nginx-proxy

## Overview
When you need to route external traffic to internal services or load balance

## Process
1. Install and configure Nginx
2. Define upstream backend servers
3. Set up location blocks for routing
4. Configure SSL/TLS termination
5. Test configuration and reload Nginx

## Examples
- Routing to multiple backend services
- SSL termination for HTTPS
- Load balancing across servers

## Limitations
Not a full application server; limited dynamic service discovery
