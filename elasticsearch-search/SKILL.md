# elasticsearch-search

## Overview
When you need powerful full-text search with ranking and filtering

## Process
1. Set up Elasticsearch cluster and index
2. Define document mappings with appropriate analyzers
3. Index documents with proper field configurations
4. Build search queries (match, term, bool, etc.)
5. Implement aggregations for faceted search

## Examples
- Building search engines
- Implementing faceted product search
- Log and analytics aggregation

## Limitations
Resource-intensive for large datasets; requires separate infrastructure
